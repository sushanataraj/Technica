          <h2>Physical Actions</h2>
          <ul>
          <li> Get 7-9 hours of sleep each night in order for your mind and body to deal with stress and allow you to function at your best. </li>
          <li> Exercise. Federal guidlines require at least 75 minutes for moderate-intensity activity and 150 minutes for vigourous-intensity activity per week. Exercise releases endorphins and reduces the body's stress hormones. </li>
          <li> Limit alcohol and caffiene intake. Drink more water instead! </li>
          <li> Eat well-balanced meals. Your energy to battle anxiety and stress comes from the nourishment you give your body! </li>

        <li> Stay positive. Doubts are the weakest in their early stages. Once you hear a doubtful or scary thought, acknowledge it as soon as it appears and recognize that it is not a true reflection of you or your situation. </li>
        <li> Pride yourself for small victories. </li>
        <li> Be nice to yourself. Do your best, but do not push yourself too hard.</li>
        <li> Think of something that makes you happy and calm. It can be people, places, moments, etc. </li>

          <li> Relax your body as much as possible. Research shows that physical responses can trick your mind. </li>
          <li> Slow your breathing. This will help you regulate your heartrate. </li>
          <li> Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique. Find five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, and one you can taste. This will help ground you to retouch with your surroundings. </li>
          <li> Be patient and be aware that it always ends. They can last half an hour or more. The more you can change your thinking, the faster it may end. </li>
